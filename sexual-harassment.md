1. **Document the Behavior:** Keep a detailed record of the incidents, including dates, times, and descriptions of what happened. Note any witnesses as well.

2. **Report the Behavior:**  We should Inform our supervisor, HR department, or the designated person responsible for handling harassment complaints. Most workplaces have procedures for reporting and addressing such issues.

3. **Seek Support:** Reach out to trusted colleagues, friends, or counselors for support and guidance. Itâ€™s important to have emotional and practical support during this time.

4. **Follow Up:** Make sure our complaint is being taken seriously by following up with the right people. And we should also check in with them to see if any actions are being taken or not. If needed, we should remind them until it's resolved.
